DuoAlly AI is pioneering the *next generation of AI allies for single-player gaming*. 

We're creating an AI-powered assistant that provides players with an interactive, game-aware ally, designed to enhance solo experiences across multiple genres. Our technology creates intelligent companions that adapt in real-time to in-game events, provide tailored support, and continuously improve through player feedback.

Our research focuses on evaluation frameworks for AI in gaming and novel approaches integrating Neo4j knowledge graphs for enhanced chatbot accuracy.
